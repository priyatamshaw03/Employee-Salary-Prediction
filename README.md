# Employee-Salary-Prediction

Approach to solving this task would involve the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, convert categorical variables to numerical representations, and perform any necessary feature scaling or                    transformation.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the data distribution, relationships between variables, and identify potential outliers or patterns.
3. Feature Selection: Determine which features are most relevant for predicting salaries. 
4. Model Selection: Choose appropriate regression models, such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.  
5. Model Training: Train each selected model on the preprocessed data.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error, etc., on both training and test data. 
7. Select the Best Model: Choose the model with the best performance based on evaluation metrics. 
8. Model Interpretation: Interpret the model's coefficients or feature importances to understand which factors influence salaries the most
